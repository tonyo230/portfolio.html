<h1>Tony's Favourite Movies 2024</H1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3> (1) A Tribe Called Judah</h3>
<p>Funke Akindele's "A TRIBE CALLED JUDAH", comes across as a very coulorful story. Where the clourfulness stems from the diversified nature of the characters, having been so casted to have a represention of the Western, Southern, Eastern and Northern parts of Nigeria. Given how deeply divided along ethnic lines the country seem to have become in more recent times, the movie doesn't only achieve its aim in ensuring that it keeps its audience entertained (something it does brilliantly well by infusion of humour into strong themed messages), but also present to  audience of a diversified society the beauty in diversity, as evidenced in the diverse Nigerian vernaculars used by its characters, thus stirring in the hearts of its diverse audience a positive feeling towards diversity, which is a necessary ingredient for fostering unity in a deeply divided society like ours (Nigeria).</p>
<p>Funke Akindele, through her movie, didn't just prove she's a believer in the mantra, "there's unity in diversity", as evidenced in the cultural diversity of the characters, but has also proven to be a crusader for social change as well. This is seen in the character, Jedidah Judah's (as played by Funke Akindele) loud advocacy in support of women empowerment, as well as the movie's advocacy for a strong family bond, and somewhat subtle advocacy against societal ills like thuggery, money laundering, and other forms of criminalities.</p>
<p>On a final note, I'll say the movie makes for a great watch, given its strong family oriented theme, and its attempt at convincing the audience (which I believe it did credibly well), that a home is not broken, simply because of the absence of a father figure, or because the children were all fathered by different men, but only does when the bond that binds every member is broken. Good enough, Jedidah Judah's "special" family was able to prove that.</p>
<hr />
<h3> (2) Merry Men 3</h3>
<P>The story was interesting, the plot twists were nicely inserted and they brilliantly added new characters into the trilogy without making the third installment completely deviate from the first two installments. Williams Uchemba was a nice touch of comic relief.</P>
<p>I think the director and the script writer should have done better. The car chase scene was so unentertaining, the last fights scene in the park was not good too.</p>
<hr />
<h3> (3) Breath Of Life</h3>
<p>One of my favorite classic RPGs. It's really a shame that the last time this saw a port was for the PSP because I think that everyone should have the chance to play this game.</p>
<p>Great characters, a vibrant world and a solid story that leaves you satisfied yet also wishing there was more.</p>
<p>The battle system is classic turn based, and you can play the whole game without much fuss, but if you want to put the time into it there is a depth to the system, allowing you to find masters around the world and train your characters in many different ways.</p>
<P>The dragon gene system has to be one of my favorite mechanics in a game. You collect genes that you can then mix and use with the main character to transform into different dragons. It's super fun. I wish they'd added it into the fourth game, it's one of the reasons I consider this to be my favorite game in the series.</P>
<P>If you like RPGs and can find a way to play it, I can't recommend Breath of Fire III enough.</P>
